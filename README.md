# metric_spaces
The main goal of this project is to define metric spaces and construct a completion of an arbitrary metric space.


The file "Metric Spaces and Their Completions.pdf" was used as a reference for the formalization in Lean, and can
serve as a natural language explanation to the Lean proof or vice-versa.

Goals achieved:
  - Proving that the reals are a complete metric space.
  - Defining the "set" of the completed version of a metric space.
  - Defining the distance function of the completed version of a metric space.

Goals remaining:
  - Prove that the completion construction does form a metric space.
  - Prove that it is the smallest possible completion.
